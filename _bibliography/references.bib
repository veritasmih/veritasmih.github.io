abstract = {BACKGROUND Prenatal ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and maternal chronic psychosocial stress have independently been linked to changes in mithochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn), a marker of mitochondrial response and dysfunction. Further, overlapping research shows sex-specific effects of PM2.5 and stress on developmental outcomes. Interactions among PM2.5, maternal stress, and child sex have not been examined in this context. METHODS We examined associations among exposure to prenatal PM2.5, maternal lifetime traumatic stressors, and mtDNAcn at birth in a sociodemographically diverse pregnancy cohort (N=167). Mothers' daily exposure to PM2.5 over gestation was estimated using a satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved prediction model. Lifetime exposure to traumatic stressors was ascertained using the Life Stressor Checklist-Revised; exposure was categorized as high vs. low based on a median split. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to determine mtDNAcn in placenta and cord blood leukocytes. Bayesian Distributed Lag Interaction regression models (BDLIMs) were used to statistically model and visualize the PM2.5 timing-dependent pattern of associations with mtDNAcn and explore effect modification by maternal lifetime trauma and child sex. RESULTS Increased PM2.5 exposure across pregnancy was associated with decreased mtDNAcn in cord blood (cumulative effect estimate=-0.78; 95{\%}CI -1.41, -0.16). Higher maternal lifetime trauma was associated with reduced mtDNAcn in placenta ($\beta$=-0.33; 95{\%}CI -0.63, -0.02). Among women reporting low trauma, increased PM2.5 exposure late in pregnancy (30-38weeks gestation) was significantly associated with decreased mtDNAcn in placenta; no significant association was found in the high trauma group. BDLIMs identified a significant 3-way interaction between PM2.5, maternal trauma, and child sex. Specifically, PM2.5 exposure between 25 and 40weeks gestation was significantly associated with increased placental mtDNAcn among boys of mothers reporting high trauma. In contrast, PM2.5 exposure in this same window was significantly associated with decreased placental mtDNAcn among girls of mothers reporting low trauma. Similar 3-way interactive effects were observed in cord blood. CONCLUSIONS These results indicate that joint exposure to PM2.5 in late pregnancy and maternal lifetime trauma influence mtDNAcn at the maternal-fetal interface in a sex-specific manner. Additional studies will assist in understanding if the sex-specific patterns reflect distinct pathophysiological processes in addition to mitochondrial dysfunction.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Impact of ambient pollution upon children's asthma may differ by sex, and exposure dose and timing. Psychosocial stress can also modify pollutant effects. These associations have not been examined for in utero ambient nitrate exposure. OBJECTIVES We implemented Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs), to identify sensitive prenatal windows for the influence of NO3- on child asthma, accounting for effect modification by sex and stress. METHODS Analyses included 752 mother-child dyads. Daily ambient nitrate (NO3-) exposure during pregnancy was derived using a hybrid chemical transport (Geos-Chem)/land-use regression model and natural-log (ln) transformed. Prenatal maternal stress was indexed by a negative life events (NLEs) score [high (≥3) vs. low ({\textless}3)]. The outcome was clinician-diagnosed asthma by age 6 years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Most mothers were Hispanic (54{\%}) or Black (29{\%}), had ≤high school education (66{\%}), never smoked (80{\%}), and reported low prenatal stress (58{\%}); 15{\%} of children developed asthma. BDILMs adjusted for maternal age, race, education, pre-pregnancy obesity, atopy, and smoking status identified two sensitive windows-7-19 and 33-40 weeks gestation-during which increased NO3- was associated with greater odds of asthma, specifically among boys born to mothers reporting high prenatal stress. Cumulative effects of NO3- across pregnancy were also significant in this subgroup (OR=2.64, 95{\%}CI=1.27-5.39; per IQR increase in ln-NO3-). CONCLUSIONS Prenatal NO3- exposure during distinct sensitive windows was associated with incident asthma in boys concurrently exposed to high prenatal stress.},

abstract = {Background Evolving animal studies and limited epidemiological data show that prenatal air pollution exposure is associated with childhood obesity. Timing of exposure and child sex may play an important role in these associations. We applied an innovative method to examine sex-specific sensitive prenatal windows of exposure to PM2.5 on anthropometric measures in preschool-aged children. Methods Analyses included 239 children born ≥ 37 weeks gestation in an ethnically-mixed lower-income urban birth cohort. Prenatal daily PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatio-temporal model. Body mass index z-score (BMI-z), fat mass, {\%} body fat, subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness, waist and hip circumferences and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were assessed at age 4.0 ± 0.7 years. Using Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs), we examined sex differences in sensitive windows of weekly averaged PM2.5 levels on these measures, adjusting for child age, maternal age, education, race/ethnicity, and pre-pregnancy BMI. Results Mothers were primarily Hispanic (55{\%}) or Black (26{\%}), had ≤ 12 years of education (66{\%}) and never smoked (80{\%}). Increased PM2.5 exposure 8–17 and 15–22 weeks gestation was significantly associated with increased BMI z-scores and fat mass in boys, but not in girls. Higher PM2.5 exposure 10–29 weeks gestation was significantly associated with increased WHR in girls, but not in boys. Prenatal PM2.5 was not significantly associated with other measures of body composition. Estimated cumulative effects across pregnancy, accounting for sensitive windows and within-window effects, were 0.21 (95{\%}CI = 0.01–0.37) for BMI-z and 0.36 (95{\%}CI = 0.12–0.68) for fat mass (kg) in boys, and 0.02 (95{\%}CI = 0.01–0.03) for WHR in girls, all per µg/m3 increase in PM2.5. Conclusions Increased prenatal PM2.5 exposure was more strongly associated with indices of increased whole body size in boys and with an indicator of body shape in girls. Methods to better characterize vulnerable windows may provide insight into underlying mechanisms contributing to sex-specific associations.},

OBJECTIVE We prospectively examined associations between co-exposure to prenatal particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) and maternal stress on childhood asthma (n=736). METHODS Daily PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy was estimated using a validated satellite-based spatio-temporally resolved prediction model. Prenatal maternal negative life events (NLEs) were dichotomized around the median (high: NLE≥3; low: NLE{\textless}3). We employed Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs) to identify sensitive windows for prenatal PM2.5 exposure on children's asthma by age 6, and determine effect modification by maternal stress and child sex. RESULTS BDLIMs identified a critical window of exposure (19-23 weeks gestation, cumulative OR=1.15, 95{\%}CI=1.03-1.26; per IQR (1.7 $\mu$g/m(3)) increase in prenatal PM2.5 level) during which children concomitantly exposed to prenatal PM2.5 and maternal stress had increased risk of asthma. No significant association was seen in children born to women reporting low prenatal stress. When examining modifying effects of prenatal stress and fetal sex, we found that boys born to mothers with higher prenatal stress were most vulnerable (19-21 weeks gestation, cumulative OR=1.28, 95{\%}CI=1.15-1.41; per IQR increase in PM2.5).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Changes to school food environments and practices that lead to improved dietary behavior are a powerful strategy to reverse the childhood obesity epidemic. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effects of school food environments and practices, characterized by access to competitive foods and beverages, school lunches, and nutrition promotion, on children's consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, low-nutrient energy-dense foods, and fruits/vegetables at school. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using data from the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, a nationally representative sample of public school districts, schools, and children in school year 2004-2005. Data from school principals and foodservice directors, school menu analysis, and on-site observations were used to characterize school food environments and practices. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recalls. SUBJECTS/SETTING: The sample consists of 287 schools and 2,314 children in grades one through 12. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Ordinary least squares regression was used to identify the association between school food environments and practices (within elementary, middle, and high schools) and dietary outcomes, controlling for other school and child/family characteristics. RESULTS: Sugar-sweetened beverages obtained at school contributed a daily mean of 29 kcal in middle school children and 46 kcal in high school children across all school children. Attending a school without stores or snack bars was estimated to reduce sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 22 kcal per school day in middle school children (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01) and by 28 kcal in high school children (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01). The lack of a pouring rights contract in a school reduced sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 16 kcal (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.05), and no {\{}{\`{a}}{\}} la carte offerings in a school reduced consumption by 52 kcal (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.001) in middle school children. The most effective practices for reducing energy from low-energy, energy-dense foods were characteristics of the school meal program; not offering french fries reduced low-nutrient, energy-dense foods consumption by 43 kcal in elementary school children (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01) and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption by 41 kcal in high school children (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To improve children's diet and reduce obesity continued changes to school food environments and practices are essential. Removing sugar-sweetened beverages from school food stores and snack bars, improving {\{}{\`{a}}{\}} la carte choices, and reducing the frequency of offering french fries merit testing as strategies to reduce energy from low-nutrient, energy-dense foods at school.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Variation in the quality of ambulatory care may be a key factor in explaining disparities in health, and these disparities have large cost implications. PURPOSE: This study identified differences in hospitalization rates for elderly African-American and white Marylanders for eight ambulatory care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs). It assessed the relative contribution of race to disparities in preventable hospitalizations after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors as well as underlying prevalence. It also estimated the excess cost associated with these disparities. METHODS: Using prevention quality indicator specifications from the Agency for Healthcare and Research Quality applied to 2006 Medicare claims data, eight ACSC hospitalization measures were developed for 569,896 Maryland Medicare beneficiaries. The analysis was conducted in 2008. A Poisson regression model identified race, age, gender, and income as factors associated with differences in ACSC hospitalization rates. Excess costs were estimated from excess hospitalizations of African Americans and the median cost per admission. RESULTS: African Americans had significantly higher rates of ACSC hospitalizations than whites for five of eight conditions after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. Excess costs from disparities in quality ranged from {\$}8 million (heart failure) to {\$}38,000 (urinary tract infection). CONCLUSIONS: Race may be a key predictor of preventable hospitalizations for some ACSCs. Racial disparities in these hospitalizations represent excess costs to Medicare. Because ACSC admissions are potentially preventable with optimal ambulatory care, improving care for minority populations may reduce disparities and lower hospital costs.},

abstract = {Because childhood obesity is such a threat to the physical, mental, and social health of youth, there is a great need to identify effective strategies to reduce its prevalence. The objective of this study was to estimate the mean calories from added sugars that are saved by switching sugar-sweetened beverages (including soda, fruit-flavored drinks, and sport drinks) and flavored milks consumed to unflavored low-fat milk ({\{}{\textless}{\}}1{\{}{\%}{\}} fat) at meals and water between meals. Simulation analyses used 24-hour dietary recall data from the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study (n=2,314), a 2005 national cross-sectional study of schools and students participating in the National School Lunch Program, to estimate changes in mean calories from added sugars both at and away from school. Overall, these changes translated to a mean of 205 calories or a 10{\{}{\%}{\}} savings in energy intake across all students (8{\{}{\%}{\}} among children in elementary school and 11{\{}{\%}{\}} in middle and high schools). Eighty percent of the daily savings were attributed to beverages consumed away from school, with results consistent across school level, sex, race/ethnicity, and weight status. Children's consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages at home contributed the greatest share of empty calories from added sugars. Such findings indicate that parental education should focus on the importance of reducing or eliminating sugar-sweetened beverages served at home. This conclusion has implications for improving children's food and beverage environments for food and nutrition educators and practitioners, other health care professionals, policy makers, researchers, and parents.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concerns about the diets of school-aged children and new nutrition recommendations for the US population have increased interest in the nutritional quality of meals available through the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. OBJECTIVE: This article updates national estimates of the food energy and nutrient content of school meals and compares these estimates to federal nutrient standards established under the 1995 School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children. DESIGN: Data were collected as part of the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, a nationally representative cross-sectional study fielded during school year 2004-2005. Menu and recipe data for a typical school week were collected in a mail survey with telephone assistance. Nutrient information for common commercially prepared food items was obtained from manufacturers, to supplement the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies used to analyze the data. Analyses were conducted for meals offered and meals served to (selected by) children. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Samples of 130 public school districts that offered federally subsidized school meals, and 398 schools within those districts, participated in the study. Foodservice managers in each school completed a menu survey. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Descriptive tabulations present weighted means, proportions, and standard errors for elementary, middle, and high schools, and for all schools combined. RESULTS: Most schools offered and served meals that met the standards for protein, vitamins, and minerals. Fewer than one third of schools met the standards for energy from fat or saturated fat in the average lunch, whereas three fourths or more met the fat standards in school breakfasts. For both meals, average levels of sodium were high and fiber was low relative to Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: For school meals to meet nutrient standards and promote eating behaviors consistent with the Dietary Guidelines, future policy, practice, and research should focus on reducing levels of fat and sodium and increasing fiber.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Identify disparities by race/ethnicity and obesity status in the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and other beverages among United States schoolchildren to help tailor interventions to reduce childhood obesity. DESIGN: Secondary data analysis using beverage intake data from 24-hour dietary recalls and measured height and weight from the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, a 2004-2005 nationally representative sample of school-aged children and schools. SETTING: Schools participating in the National School Lunch Program (n = 287). PARTICIPANTS: Children in grades 1-12 with a completed 24-hour dietary recall (n = 2,314). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Percentage of children consuming beverages in 8 beverage categories by school level and consumption location. ANALYSIS: Two-tailed t tests to determine significant differences (P {\{}{\textless}{\}} .05) between the proportions of children consuming beverages by race/ethnicity and weight status. RESULTS: Beverage consumption patterns did not substantially differ across weight status groups, but they differed by race/ethnicity in the home. Non-Hispanic black elementary schoolchildren consumed nonsoda SSBs more often and unflavored, low-fat milk less often at home than non-Hispanic white schoolchildren. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Higher consumption of SSBs coupled with a lower consumption of milk is disproportionately affecting non-Hispanic black schoolchildren. Targeted interventions by racial/ethnic group are needed to promote more healthful beverage choices among schoolchildren, particularly at home.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Scientists and regulators are often faced with complex decisions, where use of scarce resources must be prioritized using collections of diverse information. The Toxicological Prioritization Index (ToxPi™) was developed to enable integration of multiple sources of evidence on exposure and/or safety, transformed into transparent visual rankings to facilitate decision making. The rankings and associated graphical profiles can be used to prioritize resources in various decision contexts, such as testing chemical toxicity or assessing similarity of predicted compound bioactivity profiles. The amount and types of information available to decision makers are increasing exponentially, while the complex decisions must rely on specialized domain knowledge across multiple criteria of varying importance. Thus, the ToxPi bridges a gap, combining rigorous aggregation of evidence with ease of communication to stakeholders. RESULTS: An interactive ToxPi graphical user interface (GUI) application has been implemented to allow straightforward decision support across a variety of decision-making contexts in environmental health. The GUI allows users to easily import and recombine data, then analyze, visualize, highlight, export and communicate ToxPi results. It also provides a statistical metric of stability for both individual ToxPi scores and relative prioritized ranks. AVAILABILITY: The ToxPi GUI application, complete user manual and example data files are freely available from http://comptox.unc.edu/toxpi.php.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe the availability of competitive foods in US public schools, consumption of competitive foods by children, and contributions of competitive foods to energy intakes. DESIGN: The study used data from the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, a cross-sectional study that included a national sample of public school districts, schools, and children in the 2004-2005 school year. On-site observations were used to document the availability of competitive foods and a 24-hour recall was used to assess children's consumption of competitive foods. SUBJECTS/SETTING: The study included 287 schools and 2,314 children in grades 1 through 12. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Most analyses were limited to estimation of means and proportions. Two-tailed t tests were used to test the significance of differences between children who did and did not eat a school lunch. RESULTS: In school year 2004-2005, competitive foods were widely available in public schools. Overall, 40{\{}{\%}{\}} of children consumed one or more competitive foods on a typical school day. The most commonly consumed competitive foods were foods and beverages that were low in nutrients and energy-dense. Children who ate a school lunch were significantly less likely than children who did not eat a school lunch to consume competitive foods (36{\{}{\%}{\}} vs 45{\{}{\%}{\}}; P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01); however, the leading competitive food choices for both groups of children were foods that were low in nutrients and energy-dense. On average, competitive food consumers who ate school lunches obtained 159 calories from competitive foods that were low in nutrients and energy-dense, compared with 201 calories for competitive food consumers who did not eat school lunches (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In school year 2004-2005, competitive foods were widely available and consumed in US public schools and the most commonly consumed competitive foods were low in nutrients and energy-dense. These data support the need for improvements in school food environments and policies and provide a useful baseline for monitoring change as schools work to make these improvements.},

abstract = {High-throughput screening (HTS) of environmental chemicals is used to identify chemicals with high potential for adverse human health and environmental effects from among the thousands of untested chemicals. Predicting physiologically relevant activity with HTS data requires estimating the response of a large number of chemicals across a battery of screening assays based on sparse dose-response data for each chemical-assay combination. Many standard dose-response methods are inadequate because they treat each curve separately and under-perform when there are as few as 6-10 observations per curve. We propose a semiparametric Bayesian model that borrows strength across chemicals and assays. Our method directly parametrizes the efficacy and potency of the chemicals as well as the probability of response. We use the ToxCast data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as motivation. We demonstrate that our hierarchical method provides more accurate estimates of the probability of response, efficacy, and potency than separate curve estimation in a simulation study. We use our semiparametric method to compare the efficacy of chemicals in the ToxCast data to well-characterized reference chemicals on estrogen receptor $\alpha$ (ER$\alpha$) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor $\gamma$ (PPAR$\gamma$) assays, then estimate the probability that other chemicals are active at lower concentrations than the reference chemicals.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe patterns of consumption of "empty calories"--low-nutrient, energy-dense foods, including sugar-sweetened beverages--by eating location among National School Lunch Program (NSLP) participants and nonparticipants. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study using 24-hour dietary recall data from the 2004-2005 third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study. SUBJECTS/SETTING: A nationally representative sample of 2,314 children in grades one through 12, including 1,386 NSLP participants. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Comparisons, using t tests, of the proportion of children consuming low-nutrient, energy-dense foods and beverages, mean daily energy and energy from low-nutrient, energy-dense foods, and energy density by NSLP participation status. RESULTS: On a typical school day, children consumed 527 "empty calories" during a 24-hour period. Eating at home provided the highest mean amount of energy from low-nutrient, energy-dense foods (276 kcal vs 174 kcal at school and 78 kcal at other locations). NSLP participants consumed less energy from sugar-sweetened beverages at school than nonparticipants (11 kcal vs 39 kcal in elementary schools and 45 kcal vs 61 kcal in secondary schools, P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01), but more energy from low-nutrient, energy-dense solid foods such as french fries and higher-fat baked goods in secondary schools (157 kcal vs 127 kcal, P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01). Participants were not more likely to consume sugar-sweetened beverages or low-nutrient, energy-dense foods at home or other locations. School lunch participants' consumption at school was less energy-dense than nonparticipants' consumption at school (P{\{}{\textless}{\}}0.01). Energy density was highest for consumption at locations away from home and school. CONCLUSIONS: Improving home eating behaviors, where the largest proportion of total daily and energy from low-nutrient, energy-dense foods are consumed (especially from sugar-sweetened beverages, chips, and baked goods) is warranted. At schools, consumption of energy from low-nutrient, energy-dense foods may be reduced by limiting access to competitive foods and beverages, enforcing strong school wellness policies, and minimizing the frequency of offering french fries and similar potato products and higher-fat baked goods in school meals or {\{}{\`{a}}{\}} la carte.},

abstract = {When estimating the effect of an exposure or treatment on an outcome it is important to select the proper subset of confounding variables to include in the model. Including too many covariates increases mean square error on the effect of interest while not including confounding variables biases the exposure effect estimate. We propose a decision-theoretic approach to confounder selection and effect estimation. We first estimate the full standard Bayesian regression model and then post-process the posterior distribution with a loss function that penalizes models omitting important confounders. Our method can be fit easily with existing software and in many situations without the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, resulting in computation on the order of the least squares solution. We prove that the proposed estimator has attractive asymptotic properties. In a simulation study we show that our method outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate our method by estimating the effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure on birth weight in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter the distribution of ambient ozone levels and temperatures which, in turn, may impact public health. Much research has focused on the effect of short-term ozone exposures on mortality and morbidity while controlling for temperature as a confounder, but less is known about the joint effects of ozone and temperature. The extent of the health effects of changing ozone levels and temperatures will depend on whether these effects are additive or synergistic. In this paper we propose a spatial, semi-parametric model to estimate the joint ozone-temperature risk surfaces in 95 US urban areas. Our methodology restricts the ozone-temperature risk surfaces to be monotone in ozone and allows for both nonadditive and nonlinear effects of ozone and temperature. We use data from the National Mortality and Morbidity Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) and show that the proposed model fits the data better than additive linear and nonlinear models. We then examine the synergistic effect of ozone and temperature both nationally and locally and find evidence of a nonlinear ozone effect and an ozone-temperature interaction at higher temperatures and ozone concentrations.},

Models included controls for sociodemographic characteristics of schools and children, to control for potential endogeneity of school environments and practices, as well as controls for children's dietary and physical activity behaviors outside of school. RESULTS: Among elementary school children, offering french fries and similar potato products in subsidized school meals more than once per week and offering dessert more than once per week were each associated with a significantly higher likelihood of obesity. Among middle school children, the availability of low-nutrient, energy-dense foods in vending machines in or near the foodservice area was associated with a higher BMI z score, and the availability of such foods for {\`{a}} la carte purchase in the cafeteria was associated with a lower BMI z score. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this analysis suggest that limiting children's access to low-nutrient, energy-dense foods at school may hold promise as a tactic for reducing children's total calorie intake and controlling children's BMI.},

abstract = {Epidemiological research supports an association between maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and adverse children's health outcomes. Advances in exposure assessment and statistics allow for estimation of both critical windows of vulnerability and exposure effect heterogeneity. Simultaneous estimation of windows of vulnerability and effect heterogeneity can be accomplished by fitting a distributed lag model (DLM) stratified by subgroup. However, this can provide an incomplete picture of how effects vary across subgroups because it does not allow for subgroups to have the same window but different within-window effects or to have different windows but the same within-window effect. Because the timing of some developmental processes are common across subpopulations of infants while for others the timing differs across subgroups, both scenarios are important to consider when evaluating health risks of prenatal exposures. We propose a new approach that partitions the DLM into a constrained functional predictor that estimates windows of vulnerability and a scalar effect representing the within-window effect directly. The proposed method allows for heterogeneity in only the window, only the within-window effect, or both. In a simulation study we show that a model assuming a shared component across groups results in lower bias and mean squared error for the estimated windows and effects when that component is in fact constant across groups. We apply the proposed method to estimate windows of vulnerability in the association between prenatal exposures to fine particulate matter and each of birth weight and asthma incidence, and estimate how these associations vary by sex and maternal obesity status in a Boston-area prospective pre-birth cohort study.},
